    Hello, my name is Rose McCormack and I am an aspiring Computer Scientist. I hope that
    my website will allow people to look at my academic and personal resources I currently
    use to expand my knowledge on applications and theory within the field of Computer Science, 
    along with my passion for learning most things.
