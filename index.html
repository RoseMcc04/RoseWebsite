      Introduction
    </h2>
    <p>
      Hello, my name is Rose McCormack and I am an aspiring Computer Scientist. I hope that
      my website will allow people to look at my academic and personal resources I currently
      use to expand my knowledge on applications and theory within the field of Computer Science,
      along with my passion for learning most things.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also hope that I can use my website as an expression of my interests. In August of 2007,
      I was diagnosed as PDD-NOS and ASD (Pervaisive Developmental Delay - Not Otherwise Specified,
      Autism Spectrum Disorder). This affects my ability to express myself creatively along with hampering
      my communication and social skills.
