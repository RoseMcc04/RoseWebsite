      Introduction
    </h2>
    <p>
      Hello, my name is Rose McCormack and I am an aspiring Computer Scientist. I hope that
      my website will allow people to look at my academic and personal resources I currently
      use to expand my knowledge on applications and theory within the field of Computer Science,
      along with my passion for learning most things.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also hope that I can use my website as an expression of my interests. In August of 2007,
      I was diagnosed as PDD-NOS and ASD (Pervaisive Developmental Delay - Not Otherwise Specified,
      Autism Spectrum Disorder). This affects my ability to express myself creatively along with hampering
      my communication and social skills.

    <h2>My Interests</h2>
    <p>
      I have many interests, however, most of them are within the field of computer science. This is due
      to a newfound love for learning after starting my transition, as well as my enjoyment in learning
      new problem-solving skills. My computer science interests are in the analysis of algorithms and 
      learning about different frameworks for software design and development. On the contrary, I enjoy 
      learning about geography and popular culture, specifically with geopolitics and the sociology of
      the modern internet.
