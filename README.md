# RoseWebsite

Hello, my name is Rose. I usually prefer to learn the object-oriented paradigm of programming along with algorithm analysis. However, I wanted to have a tiny bit of fun and challenge my creative side by making a personal website from scratch. The reason I am not using JavaScript for interactibility is due to the fact that I am using this as a personal project and not as an academic project. I may involve such ideas in the future, but not currently. 

## Notes

I have a resources page along with my "fun things" page for extra content and future research.
